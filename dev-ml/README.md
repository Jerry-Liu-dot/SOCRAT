# SOCR TensorFlow.JS Teachable Machine

## Description

A highly customizable, browser-based machine learning and visualization module 
for U-M SOCR project data.


## TODO for Fall 2021

1. Review TensorBoard Projector source code on [Github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/64d26670eafe974992dffc529718d741adb379e2/docs/tensorboard_projector_plugin.ipynb)
   and explore functionalities on [BrainViewer](https://socr.umich.edu/HTML5/SOCR_TensorBoard_UKBB/CSCD_tSNE_UKBB_Demo.html#Try)
2. Extract projector and make it something that can be embedded in a 
   HTML5/JavaScript browser-based interface.
3. Include such projector into the Teachable Machine architecture and 
   develop a UI for the Teachable Machine.
4. Incorporate the Teachable Machine into the SOCRAT website, enabling it to 
   use native SOCRAT demo datasets.
